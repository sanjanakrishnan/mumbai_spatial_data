Note on format: I have used GeoJSON format which is used by web developers and can also be imported in GIS, R, Python easily. They can be converted to shapefiles, kml or other formats through code (refer [link](https://github.com/datameet/maps)) or many free online services such as [Map Shaper](https://mapshaper.org/) or [My Geo Data](https://mygeodata.cloud/converter/)
